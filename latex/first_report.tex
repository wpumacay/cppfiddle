About the problem being studied:

The problem is the circle packing problem, which consists in the following:

"Find the minimum radius R of a circle container that can enclose n circles without overlaps inside the container"

A more formal way of defining the problem is as follows:

"D0, ... foo"


Description of the metaheuristic(s) used:

Tabu search and Variable Neighborhood Descend -> foo


Description of the algorithm:

ITS-VND

Description of the instances used:

Instances used :

LBFGS
Tabu Search
VND
Vaccancy Search algorithm
Perturbation strategy


Plan for the implementation of the algorithms:

Implement all necessary for ITS-VND algorithm and test it according to the benchmarks. Also implement one of the other methods to make a comparison.
